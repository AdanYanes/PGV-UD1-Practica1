# PGV-UD1-Practica1

In this project, we will develop a program capable on read a file, get the text inside it and then count each-one of the vowels on it.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to analyze a given text for vowel frequency. It processes a provided text file, counts the occurrences of each vowel (A, E, I, O, U), and outputs the results to individual files. The program then displays the vowel counts and cleans up the generated files.

## Project Objectives

- Coun the number of vowels on a text file.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following classes:

- `Main`: Main executable of the project.
- `ProcessLauncher`: Auxiliar class made for launching several sub-process.
- `Utils`: Auxiliar class made for storing static methods used by `Main` class`.
- `VowelCounter`: Executable class launched by `ProcessLauncher` class.
